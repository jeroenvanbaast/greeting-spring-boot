This is an example output for a service running at http://localhost:8080:

== Get a greeting by name

A get request that is used to find a greeting by name

.request
include::{snippets}/byName/http-request.adoc[]

.response
include::{snippets}/byName/http-response.adoc[]

.response-fields
include::{snippets}/byName/response-fields.adoc[]

== Create greeting
.request
include::{snippets}/createGreeting/http-request.adoc[]

.response
include::{snippets}/createGreeting/http-response.adoc[]

.response-fields
include::{snippets}/createGreeting/response-fields.adoc[]

As you can see the format is very simple, and in fact you always get the same message.
